#### This application is currently under the project code name BootcampX. The app will allow our staff to help students and mentors better and faster by offering quick insight into data like assignment completion and the effectiveness of assistance requests.

#### For the BootcampX project, you will be responsible for writing all of the queries to get data from the database. That means writing a lot of SELECT statements, without having to worry about any JavaScript, HTML, or CSS. Once we have all of the queries written, the other devs can connect the backend, front end, and database together to complete the application.
